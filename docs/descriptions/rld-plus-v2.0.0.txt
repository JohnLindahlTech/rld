RLD+ is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension designed to automatically reload any website at a specified interval. It offers second-level granularity, giving you precise control over your refresh rates.

Now with multi-tab support – reload multiple tabs simultaneously, each with independent timers and settings!

* Visual Countdown: The extension icon displays a live countdown timer, so you always know when the next reload will occur.
* Management View: View and control all active timers across tabs in one place. Access it by clicking the list icon in the popup header.

   ** Open Tab: Switch to any tab with an active timer
   ** Start/Stop Timers: Play or pause timers for specific tabs
   ** Remove Timers: Delete timer configurations for tabs you no longer need
